# Plan It

Link to website : https://fado-management.herokuapp.com/

Hello! This is my project Plan it, the goal of this app was too have a simple clock in and clock out app for small businesses along with scheduling. I wanted to make this 
for a friend because he did not want all the additional features that are included forcefully in other applications. 
This application is tailored to his specific needs and uses additional middleware to protect the users. The app uses google authentication 
for logging in and out.
